These are the source files my publishing platform - a blog for articles I write.
It uses jekyll/github and is partially based on both the former GitHub Pages page and the [Tom Preston-Werner blog](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

The static branch is is gh-pages.
This branch also includes the source code examples for the articles.
